 Rules of the game :
 
    This board game is played by two players, one against the other on two grids where 5 ships set up by the players are placed.
    The goal is to sink all the opponent's ships. It is both a puzzle game and a game of chance.
    At the start of the game, each player places all the boats strategically on his grid as he wishes. The goal is to complicate the task of his opponent as much as possible, that     is to say to destroy all your ships. Of course, the player does not see his opponent's grid.
    Once all the ships are in play, the game can begin. One by one, the players shoot at each other to destroy the enemy ships.
    If a player shoots at an enemy ship, the computer must report it. He cannot play twice in a row and must wait for the other player's turn.
    If the player does not hit a ship, the computer signals it.
    If the ship is completely hit, the computer must report it.
    White pawns and red pawns are used to remember missed shots (white) and hits (red). It is essential to use them so as not to shoot twice at the same place and therefore not       waste time unnecessarily. These pawns are placed on the grid above.
 Game design:

      In a war, ships on either side are moved out of sight of the opponents. The goal is to destroy the enemy fleet while suffering the least damage. So after one uses his cannon       he has to wait for the reload then the role of the opponent comes and he tries his luck, the moment a ship has destroyed the fleet in question arises in danger due to the         lack of troops, then he must make up for his disadvantage. So the fleet that completely destroys itself is the most cowardly and the other is the winner and stronger,             therefore it wins the war.
